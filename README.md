# JPEG-to-PNG-Converter

JPEG-to-PNG Converter using tkinter and Pillow(PIL fork)

# Pillow

Pillow is the friendly PIL fork by Alex Clark and Contributors. PIL is the Python Imaging Library by Fredrik Lundh and Contributors.

The Python Imaging Library adds image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter.

This library provides extensive file format support, an efficient internal representation, and fairly powerful image processing capabilities.

The core image library is designed for fast access to data stored in a few basic pixel formats. It should provide a solid foundation for a general image processing tool.

# tkinter
The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.

Both Tk and tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, as well as on Windows systems
